Tough times, weak minds
I'm running through this city and I know it's my time.
Analog waves, information exchange
Visions that rush me at breakneck pace.
Gotta fly below radar, run beneath the camera eye
Gonna tell the truth and run.

Someone sits down to say grace
Someone fronts it to save face
I'm still dreaming of a revolution that's a bad idea
Still dreaming of a revolution

Running through this city and I know it's my time
Running through this city and I know it's my time


*******

We are voices of extremes
anxious and patient
joyful and turbulent
entwined in accidental grand design


*********

I was a kid driving blind when I wanted distraction
looking for God or a new manic high
looking for privilege or a new discontentment
looking for someone to blame

I had the best of intentions
I had the best laid plans

Checked in estatic, and checked out of mind
Checked back in, for a quick look around


*********

She dances for the weirdo in the mirror
Storing up moves for the dance floor
Insecure and angry rhythms
But sweet all the same
Finding release on the dance floor
Finding relief on the dance floor

And I like her for who she is
And I like her for who she is
